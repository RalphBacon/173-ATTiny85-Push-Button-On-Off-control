So a simple ATTiny85 can control the power to any attached electronic ÂµC device (3v 20v, 800mA-20A) which can include a DC-to-DC Buck-Boost circuit if you need higher voltages.

This builds on our previous circuit and adds a shedload of intelligence on the digital logic we already have. Best of all, you can tewak the code to suit whatever application you have in mind!
